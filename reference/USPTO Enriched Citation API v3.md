### v3 | Patents

###### The Enriched Citation API provides the IP5 and the public with greater insight into the patent evaluation process. It allows users to quickly view information about which references, or prior art, were cited in specific patent application office actions, including: bibliographic information of the reference, the claims that the prior art was cited against, and the relevant sections that the examiner relied upon. The API allows for daily refresh and retrieval of enrich citation data from Office Actions mailed from October 1, 2017 to 30 days prior to the current date.

The Enriched Citation API provides the IP5 and the public with greater insight into the patent evaluation process. This API release marks one of the first production implementations of the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) for data extraction at the USPTO. This quick access to an organized and prioritized citation list helps users identify relevant prior art, ultimately improving the accuracy and consistency of the patent examination. It serves as a foundation for future enhancements to the patent examiner search system.

Empowered by state-of-the-art machine learning, AI, and natural language processing algorithms, the enriched citation API analyzes the structure and content of office actions. The API then uses sophisticated information extraction and entity extraction algorithms to accurately locate:

*   the statutes used by examiners,
*   the claims rejected based on prior art,
*   the particular prior art references cited, and
*   specific relevant sections in the cited prior art references used.

An entity resolution algorithm is then used to consolidate the extraction results with the reference lists in the application, including references cited by applicants and by examiners. The process is fully automated and highly tunable, and is able to incorporate feedback from manual reviewers to improve efficiency and accuracy.

USPTO Data Set API

The Data Set API (DSAPI) allows the public users to discover and search USPTO exported data sets. This is a generic API that allows USPTO users to make any CSV based data files searchable through API. With the help of GET call, it returns the list of data fields that are searchable. With the help of POST call, data can be fetched based on the filters on the field names. Please note that POST call is used to search the actual data. The reason for the POST call is that it allows users to specify any complex search criteria without worry about the GET size limitations as well as encoding of the input parameters.

Overview
--------

Although Lucene provides the ability to create your own queries through its API, it also provides a rich query language through the Query Parser, a lexer which interprets a string into a Lucene Query using JavaCC.

Generally, the query parser syntax may change from release to release. This page describes the syntax as of the current release. If you are using a different version of Lucene, please consult the copy of docs/queryparsersyntax.html that was distributed with the version you are using.

Before choosing to use the provided Query Parser, please consider the following:

1.   If you are programmatically generating a query string and then parsing it with the query parser then you should seriously consider building your queries directly with the query API. In other words, the query parser is designed for human-entered text, not for program-generated text.
2.   Untokenized fields are best added directly to queries, and not through the query parser. If a field's values are generated programmatically by the application, then so should query clauses for this field. An analyzer, which the query parser uses, is designed to convert human-entered text to terms. Program-generated values, like dates, keywords, etc., should be consistently program-generated.
3.   In a query form, fields which are general text should use the query parser. All others, such as date ranges, keywords, etc. are better added directly through the query API. A field with a limit set of values, that can be specified with a pull-down menu should not be added to a query string which is subsequently parsed, but rather added as a TermQuery clause.

Terms
-----

A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases.

A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".

A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".

Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query (see below).

Note: The analyzer used to create the index will be used on the terms and phrases in the query string. So it is important to choose an analyzer that will not interfere with the terms used in the query string.

Fields
------

Lucene supports fielded data. When performing a search you can either specify a field, or use the default field. The field names and default field is implementation specific.

You can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon ":" and then the term you are looking for.

As an example, let's assume a Lucene index contains two fields, title and text and text is the default field. If you want to find the document entitled "The Right Way" which contains the text "don't go this way", you can enter:

title:"The Right Way" AND text:go
or

title:"Do it right" AND right
Since text is the default field, the field indicator is not required.

Note: The field is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so the query

title:Do it right
Will only find "Do" in the title field. It will find "it" and "right" in the default field (in this case the text field).

Term Modifiers
--------------

Lucene supports modifying query terms to provide a wide range of searching options.

### Wildcard Searches

Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase queries).

To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.

To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.

The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can use the search:

te?t
Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search:

test*
You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.

te*t
Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.

### Fuzzy Searches

Lucene supports fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance algorithm. To do a fuzzy search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Single word Term. For example to search for a term similar in spelling to "roam" use the fuzzy search:

roam~
This search will find terms like foam and roams.

Starting with Lucene 1.9 an additional (optional) parameter can specify the required similarity. The value is between 0 and 1, with a value closer to 1 only terms with a higher similarity will be matched. For example:

roam~0.8
The default that is used if the parameter is not given is 0.5.

### Proximity Searches

Lucene supports finding words are a within a specific distance away. To do a proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Phrase. For example to search for a "apache" and "jakarta" within 10 words of each other in a document use the search:

"jakarta apache"~10
### Range Searches

Range Queries allow one to match documents whose field(s) values are between the lower and upper bound specified by the Range Query. Range Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done lexicographically.

mod_date:[20020101 TO 20030101]
This will find documents whose mod_date fields have values between 20020101 and 20030101, inclusive. Note that Range Queries are not reserved for date fields. You could also use range queries with non-date fields:

title:{Aida TO Carmen}
This will find all documents whose titles are between Aida and Carmen, but not including Aida and Carmen.

Inclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range queries are denoted by curly brackets.

### Boosting a Term

Lucene provides the relevance level of matching documents based on the terms found. To boost a term use the caret, "^", symbol with a boost factor (a number) at the end of the term you are searching. The higher the boost factor, the more relevant the term will be.

Boosting allows you to control the relevance of a document by boosting its term. For example, if you are searching for

jakarta apache
and you want the term "jakarta" to be more relevant boost it using the ^ symbol along with the boost factor next to the term. You would type:

jakarta^4 apache
This will make documents with the term jakarta appear more relevant. You can also boost Phrase Terms as in the example:

"jakarta apache"^4 "Apache Lucene"
By default, the boost factor is 1. Although the boost factor must be positive, it can be less than 1 (e.g. 0.2)

Boolean Operators
-----------------

Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Lucene supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note: Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS).

The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used. The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document. This is equivalent to a union using sets. The symbol || can be used in place of the word OR.

To search for documents that contain either "jakarta apache" or just "jakarta" use the query:

"jakarta apache" jakarta
or

"jakarta apache" OR jakarta
### AND

The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol && can be used in place of the word AND.

To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" and "Apache Lucene" use the query:

"jakarta apache" AND "Apache Lucene"
### +

The "+" or required operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol exist somewhere in a the field of a single document.

To search for documents that must contain "jakarta" and may contain "lucene" use the query:

+jakarta lucene
### NOT

The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT. This is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol ! can be used in place of the word NOT.

To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query:

"jakarta apache" NOT "Apache Lucene"
Note: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results:

NOT "jakarta apache"
### -

The "-" or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the "-" symbol.

To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query:

"jakarta apache" -"Apache Lucene"

Grouping
--------

Lucene supports using parentheses to group clauses to form sub queries. This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query.

To search for either "jakarta" or "apache" and "website" use the query:

(jakarta OR apache) AND website
This eliminates any confusion and makes sure you that website must exist and either term jakarta or apache may exist.

Field Grouping
--------------

Lucene supports using parentheses to group multiple clauses to a single field.

To search for a title that contains both the word "return" and the phrase "pink panther" use the query:

title:(+return +"pink panther")

Escaping Special Characters
---------------------------

Lucene supports escaping special characters that are part of the query syntax. The current list special characters are

+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \

To escape these character use the \ before the character. For example to search for (1+1):2 use the query:

\(1\+1\)\:2
```
